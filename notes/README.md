# Notes

The original [memory.py](memory.py) was written as a hook (plugin) for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) that generated JavaScript code to draw an SVG image using [D3](https://d3js.org/).
In contrast, [memdia.js](../memdia.js) creates the SVG directly, without needing Python or MkDocs or D3.
