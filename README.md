# MemDia
JavaScript library for drawing memory diagrams.


## Usage

Include `memdia.js` in the document `<head>`:

``` html
<script src="memdia.js"></script>
```

Write code in an element with class `memdia`:

``` html
<div class="memdia">
main:
    String hello -> "world"
</div>
```

The library replaces your code with an `<svg>` when `DOMContentLoaded`.


## Example Diagram

The following Java program defines a `Person` class and creates two `Person` objects:

``` java
public class Person {

    private static int count = 0;

    private String name;
    private int pin;

    public Person(String name, int pin) {
        count++;
        this.name = name;
        this.pin = pin;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p1 = new Person("Taylor", 1989);
        Person p2 = new Person("Travis", 8713);
    }

}
```

A memory diagram has two sides: static data and stack frames are on the left, and heap objects are on the right.
At the end of `main()`, the memory diagram looks like this:

## Language Syntax

The source code for the above diagram is:

```
: Person class
    int count = 2

main:
    Person p1 -> P1
    Person p2 -> P2

P1: Person
    String name -> "Taylor"
    int pin = 1989

P2: Person
    String name -> "Travis"
    int pin = 8713
```

A diagram specification is sequence of *blocks* (multiple lines) separated by a blank line.
The first line of each block specifies the block's *name* and *type* separated by a colon.

* If no name is given before the colon, the block represents static data.
    * Example: `: Person class`
* If no type is given after the colon, the block represents a stack frame.
    * Example: `main:`
* If both a name and type are given, the block represents a heap object.
    * Example: `P1: Person`

Each subsequent line of a block represents a *variable*.
Each variable has the syntax `type name operator value`.
The type and name must be one word.
The value can be any string (including spaces).

This diagram syntax is intended to be language agnostic.
The operator can be either `=` (primitive) or `->` (reference).
The value after `->` can be an object name (like `P1`), a string literal (in double quotes), or an array (in curly braces).

Indentation is optional, and extra whitespace is ignored.
